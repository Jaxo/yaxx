<H1><A name=file><FONT color=#006644>Testcase file format</FONT></A></H1>This 
section describes the format of the testcase files. These are distributed as 
plain text files with a file name that identifies the <I>group</I> of tests 
contained in the file and a file extension (if appropriate) of 
<TT>.decTest</TT>. File names will not have embedded blanks. 
<P>The files are encoded using one byte per character, using 7-bit ASCII 
encoding. These may be converted to Unicode by treating them as UTF-8-encoded 
files or by directly converting each 7-bit character to Unicode by prefixing 
nine 0 bits. 
<P>
<HR align=left width="20%">

<H3><A name=syntax><FONT color=#006644>Testcase syntax</FONT></A></H3>Each 
testcase file consists of one or more lines (the line delimiter mechanism may 
vary, depending on the operating system). Within each line, control characters 
(those with encodings in the range 0 through 31) are not used. 
<P>Each line is treated as a sequence of <I>tokens</I>, delimited by the start 
of the line, spaces between tokens, or (after the final token) the end of the 
line. There may be more than one space between tokens, and spaces may also 
appear before the first token on a line and after the last token on a line. 
<P>If the first two characters of a token are two hyphens (<TT>--</TT>) the 
token indicates the start of a comment. The two-hyphen sequence and any 
characters that follow it, up to the end of the line on which the sequence 
occurs, are ignored (that is, they are treated as commentary). 
<P>The lines in a file may be: 
<DL>
  <P>
  <DT><I>empty</I> 
  <DD>Lines with no characters, or only space characters. These lines are 
  treated as commentary and are ignored. 
  <P></P>
  <DT><I>comments</I> 
  <DD>Lines whose first token starts a comment. These are also ignored. 
  <P></P>
  <DT><I>directives</I> 
  <DD>Lines which are used to control the testcase environment in some way, for 
  example to change the working precision. These lines have two tokens and are 
  of the form: <PRE>  <I>keyword</I>: <I>value</I>
</PRE><I></I>where the case-independent <I>keyword</I> describes the purpose 
  of the directive, and the <I>value</I> is a parameter associated with the 
  directive. The possible keywords and their values are described <A 
  href="http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/decimal/dtfile.html#direct">below</A>. 
  <P></P>
  <DT><I>tests</I> 
  <DD>Lines which describe a specific test. These lines have at least five 
  tokens, and are of the form: 
  <P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><I>id</I> <I>operation</I> <I>operand1</I> 
  <I>operand2</I> <TT>-&gt;</TT> <I>result</I> <I>conditions</I> 
  <P>where the named tokens are as follows: 
  <DL>
    <P>
    <DT><I>id</I> 
    <DD>A short name which identifies the test. It is case-independent and 
    unique in the file. In the current testcases it comprises three or four 
    alphabetic characters followed by three or four digits (for example, 
    <TT>divx101</TT>). 
    <P></P>
    <DT><I>operation</I> 
    <DD>A case-independent keyword which describes the <A 
    href="http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/decimal/dtfile.html#ops">operation</A> to 
    be carried out for this test (for example, <TT>divide</TT>). 
    <P></P>
    <DT><I>operand1</I> 
    <DD>The first (or only) operand required for the operation. The token may be 
    quoted (see below). If it is not quoted then its value is the sequence of 
    characters comprising the token, taken exactly as written. 
    <P>If the token is not quoted and its value is the octothorpe character 
    (<TT>#</TT>, also called the hash or pound sign), the operand is a <I>null 
    reference</I>. Null references are used for testing the behavior of 
    implementations which can be passed numbers by reference, where a null 
    reference would be an error. If this concept is not supported then tests 
    containing null references should be skipped. 
    <P>Otherwise, the value of the token is treated as a string, which should be 
    converted to a number using the <B>to-number</B> conversion of the base 
    specification (or, if <I>extended</I> is set as described later, using the 
    <B>to-extended-number</B> conversion of the extended specification). This 
    will raise a condition if the token is not a valid number. If the value of 
    the token is not a valid number then it must be quoted.<A name=backref.1><A 
    href="http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/decimal/dtfile.html#footnote.1"><FONT 
    size=3><SUP>[1]</SUP></FONT></A></A>&nbsp; 
    <P></P>
    <DT><I>operand2</I> 
    <DD>An optional second operand, if required for the operation. If present, 
    it has the same syntax and follows the same rules as <I>operand1</I>. 
    <P></P>
    <DT><I>result</I> 
    <DD>This defines the result of carrying out the <I>operation</I> on the 
    operand or operands. It will either be the string form of a valid number 
    (which may be quoted) or it will be the question mark character (<TT>?</TT>) 
    which indicates that the result is undefined (for example, when an error 
    condition should occur). 
    <P>When the result is a number, the string will be that produced by the 
    <B>to-scientific-string</B> conversion of the base specification, unless the 
    <I>operation</I> is <A 
    href="http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/decimal/dtfile.html#ops"><TT>toEng</TT></A> 
    in which case the string will be that produced by the 
    <B>to-engineering-string</B> conversion. 
    <P>Note that when <I>extended</I> is set (see below) then results will be 
    defined even after an error, and may have the values <TT>NaN</TT> (Not a 
    Number), <TT>sNaN</TT> (signaling NaN), <TT>Infinity</TT>, 
    <TT>-Infinity</TT>, or <TT>-0</TT>. 
    <P></P>
    <DT><I>conditions</I> 
    <DD>Zero or more tokens each of which is the case-independent name of a <A 
    href="http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/decimal/dtfile.html#condition"><I>condition</I></A> 
    set by the operation. If no condition is set then no condition tokens will 
    be present. </DD></DL></DD></DL>
<P>Any operand or result token may be quoted. That is, it may begin with a 
delimiter which is a single or double quote character and it is then only ended 
by a matching quote (which must be present and on the same line). A quote which 
matches the starting quote may be included inside a quoted operand by doubling 
up the quote; in this case it does not end the token. 
<P>The content of the quoted token (after the delimiters have been removed and 
any doubled delimiter quotes have been reduced to a single instance) forms the 
value of the token. The value may contain any 7-bit ASCII characters (other than 
the control characters, whose encodings are in the range 0 through 31), 
including spaces or the comment start sequence. 
<P><B>Example:</B> 
<P>Here is an example of a small testcase file, comprising some commentary, four 
directives which set the version and context, and some tests. <PRE>  -- simple.decTest
  -- Testcase for some simple operations.
  Version: 1.03
  
  Precision:   9
  Rounding:    half_up
  MaxExponent: 999
  
  simp001  add       1 1 -&gt; 2   -- can we get this right?
  simp002  multiply  2 2 -&gt; 4
  simp003  divide    1 3 -&gt; 0.333333333   Inexact Rounded
  simp004  divide    1 0 -&gt; ? Division_by_zero
  simp005  toSci  '1..2' -&gt; ? Conversion_syntax
</PRE>
<P><B>Note:</B> Tokens and lines do not have a length limit, however the current 
testcases are limited to a maximum token length of 1050 characters and a maximum 
line length of 4000 characters. 
<P>
<HR align=left width="20%">

<H3><A name=direct><FONT color=#006644>Directives</FONT></A></H3>Directives are 
used to control the testcase environment in some way. Each has a <I>keyword</I> 
(which is immediately followed by a colon) and a <I>value</I>. 
<P>The first three directives are required; no tests can be run without these 
three settings being specified (that is, there is no default value for these 
settings). Once set, each setting remains in force until a new directive with 
the same keyword is encountered; the setting is then replaced by the new value.

        <TR vAlign=top></TD>
          <TD><TT>precision</TT> </TD>
          <TD>An unsigned positive integer. Its value is used to set the 
            <I>precision</I> in the context for the following tests. 
            <P>If the setting exceeds the maximum precision that can be handled 
            by an implementation then following tests should be skipped (until

          <TD>A word which describes the <I>rounding</I> mode to set in the

            one of: 
            <P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;ceiling <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;down 
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;floor <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;half_down

            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;up</TT> 
            <P>Only <TT>half_up</TT> (corresponding to <I>round-half-up</I>) is

        <TR vAlign=top></TD>
          <TD><TT>maxexponent</TT> </TD>
          <TD>An unsigned integer which may be zero or positive. This value 
            describes the absolute value of the adjusted exponent beyond which 
            overflow or underflow will be raised. The following tests will 
            indicate an <A 
            href="http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/decimal/dtfile.html#condition">overflow 
            or underflow condition</A> if the magnitude of the adjusted exponent 
            exceeds this setting. (Note that if <I>extended</I> is set, a larger 
            range of exponents can be handled because subnormal values are 
            allowed.) 
            <P>Implementations, in general, will have fixed maximum exponent 
            limits, which may not match the setting in the testcase: 
            <UL>
              <LI>If the setting of <TT>maxexponent</TT> is larger than can be 
              handled, then following tests should be skipped (until the setting 
              is suitably reduced or the end of the file is reached). 
              <LI>If the setting of <TT>maxexponent</TT> is smaller than can be 
              enforced, then following tests which indicate an overflow or 
              underflow condition should be skipped (until the setting is 
              suitably changed or the end of the file is reached).

<P>The next two directives are optional: 
<TABLE cellPadding=8>

      <TABLE cellPadding=4 border=1></TR>
        <TBODY>

          <TD><B>Value</B> </TD>
        <TR vAlign=top></TD>
          <TD><TT>version</TT> </TD>
          <TD>A number which describes the version of the testcases which 
            follow. This may be up to five digits, or four digits with an 
            embedded decimal point. For example: 
            <P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;version: 1.30 </TT>
            <P>The meaning of the version number is not defined, except that 
            later versions of testcases should have a larger version number. 
          </P></TD>
        <TR vAlign=top></TD>
          <TD><TT>extended</TT> </TD>
          <TD>Either 0 or 1. This directive controls the 
            <I>extended-values</I> flag described in the extended specification. 
            The default at the start of a testcase group is 0, as required for 
            the base specification, meaning that the sign of a zero value result 
            is always 0, and subnormal values raise underflow. 
            <P>When set to 1, numbers whose value is zero may have a sign of 1, 
            operations may result in subnormal values, extra checking is 
            performed on the length of operands, the power operator has extra 
            checking, and the results of operations are defined after errors 
            (they may be 0, infinite, or NaN values). For example: 
            <P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;extended: 1 -- enable extended values 
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;div0 divide -1 0 -&gt; -Infinity Division_by_zero 
            </TT>
            <P>If an implementation does not support extended values and the 
            <I>extended</I> setting is 1 then following tests should be skipped 
            (until the extended setting is changed to 0 or the end of the file 
            is reached). </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The final directive allows testcase groups (files) to themselves be grouped 
together in a hierarchy:

        <TR vAlign=top></TD>
          <TD><TT>dectest</TT> </TD>
          <TD>A word specifying the file name (without extension) of another 
            testcase file to be processed at this point. For example, a testcase 
            which simply runs the testcases for the three division operations 
            might read: 
            <P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;-- divides.decTest -- Test divisions 
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;dectest: divide <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;dectest: divideint

            <P>Note that this directive is not an ‘include’; the current 
            settings are <I>not</I> inherited by the file to be processed – that 
            file must be processed in exactly the same way as if it were the

<P><B>Notes:</B> 
<OL>
  <LI>The condition names are simply the names from the arithmetic 
  specifications, with spaces changed to underscores so each forms a single 
  token. 
  <LI>The <TT>inexact</TT> and <TT>rounded</TT> conditions are in the extended 
  specification. They are included in the testcases, even when <I>extended</I> 
  is 0, to aid analysis and debugging. They may be moved from the extended to 
  the base specification at a later date. <BR>The <TT>rounded</TT> condition 
  indicates that an operand or the result of a test has had one or more zero or 
  non-zero digits removed by rounding. That is, the number of digits in the 
  <I>coefficient</I> of the result is fewer than in the <I>coefficient</I> of 
  the ‘ideal’ result. <BR>In contrast, the <TT>inexact</TT> condition indicates 
  only that non-zero trailing digits were removed (that is, the result would 
  compare mathematically unequal to the ideal result). 
  <LI>The <TT>insufficient_storage</TT> condition is not a predictable condition 
  and so will not appear in any testcases. It is listed here as a reminder that 
  some implementations could raise this condition for some tests. </LI></OL>
